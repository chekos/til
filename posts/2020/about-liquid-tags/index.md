## what i learned
shopify has a github pages site documenting liquid tags which is very useful and easy to use.

## how i learned
{% raw %}
i am moving soyserg.io from a hugo site to jekyll and i couldn't figure out how to have nested `{{}}` as in `{{ category/{{category | downcase }} | relative_url }}` which just doesn't work. so i moved to `{{ 'category/' | append: category | downcase | relative_url }}`
{% endraw %}
