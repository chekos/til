¡hola! 👋🏼

my name is Sergio Sánchez Zavala but i go by chekos (/che/ like Guevara, /kos/ like 'costly', in lowercase) and i do data, public policy, and most recently, research on latin american hip hop.

this section of chekos.dev is a collection of things i've learned. it was inspired by Simon Wilson's and Vicki Boykis' TIL repos.
