title: About Myst-Parser, Es Markdown Pero Rst
---

## what i learned
MyST-parser is **so easy to use** and it provides all the functionality i need to make docs without using rST.

## how i learned

i was creating the docs for [`tacosdedatos-utils`](https://tacosdedatos-utils.rtfd.io) and i rather not touch rST ever. i had seen [@choldraf](https://twitter.com/choldraf) tweet [about MyST before](https://twitter.com/choldgraf/status/1272633413132943360?s=20) but i had not had the need to use it.

today i made the documentation for that small utils package and it was actually a pleasant experience? the underlying concepts of rST (roles, directives, etc etc) are still a little fuzzy but the syntax makes a ton more sense now so it's one less challenge for me.
