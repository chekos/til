## what i learned
you can use the tags `raw` and `endraw` to escape liquid tags.

## how i learned
in the [previous TIL](../liquid-tags-cheatsheet) i tried to write the following

{% raw %}
i am moving soyserg.io from a hugo site to jekyll and i couldn't figure out how to have nested `{{}}` as in `{{ category/{{category | downcase }} | relative_url }}` which just doesn't work. so i moved to `{{ 'category/' | append: category | downcase | relative_url }}`
{% endraw %}

but it was not possible off the bat because of the double `{}`. at first i tried to escape them as `\{\{\}\}` but that did not work.

{% raw %}
turns out the answer is the `{% raw %}` tag. 
{% endraw %}

the paragraph then looks like this in the markdown file

{% raw %}
```markdown
`{% raw %}`
i am moving soyserg.io from a hugo site to jekyll and i couldn't figure out how to have nested `{{}}` as in `{{ category/{{category | downcase }} | relative_url }}` which just doesn't work. so i moved to `{{ 'category/' | append: category | downcase | relative_url }}`
`% endraw %`
```
{% endraw %}
